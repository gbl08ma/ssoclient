# ssoclient
golang client for the Barebones CMS SSO system ( http://barebonescms.com/documentation/sso/ )

This only supports the bare minimum I needed it to support.

- Blowfish secret keys only
- Dual encryption mode only
- Remote login not supported
- `CanAutoLogin` functionality not supported
- User information updates not tested
- Can read field and tag mapping information, whether users are admins, etc.

It is used in the disturbancesmlx project: https://github.com/gbl08ma/disturbancesmlx
